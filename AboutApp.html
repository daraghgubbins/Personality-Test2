    <div class="col-xs-12" style="background-color:lavender;"><h3>Personality Test Theory</h3><p>In the early 20th Century Carl Jung developed a concept that each
	individual falls into one of two categories, Introversion or Extraversion. Jung also developed several additional concepts. Jung believed that each person 
	prefers Judging functions (either Thinking or Feeling) or Perceiving functions (either Sensing or Intuition) to rely on in everyday situations.<br><br>
		In the 1920's a teacher named Katharine Cook Briggs noticed Jung's theory and together with her daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, they developed a way
	to describe each person's preferences using Jung's theory. Both Katharine and Isabel co-authored on of the most popular personality indicators used today, the 
	Myers-Briggs Type Indicator &#174; - this is how the four-letter preferences came to light.<br><br>
	&#149; Extraversion (E) or Introversion <br>
	&#149; Intuition (N) or Sensing (S) <br>
	&#149; Feeling (F) or Thinking (T)<br>
	&#149; Perceiving (P) or Judging (J)<br><br>
	The Myers-Briggs theory and the Jungian Traits have introduced a number of additional personality models, most noteably the Big Five Personality Traits&#169;

	final year project at National Unversity of Ireland Galway.<br><br>
	The four-letter acronym obtained from completing this personality test simply outlines the users preference towards each of the 16 personality types.
	If an individual falls under the Introverted preference this does not imply that the individual does not show any characteristics of an Extroversion,
	it simply indicates that their dominant preference is with the Introversion personality trait. This is the same for the remaining three personality trait pairs. 
	The four-letter result therefore indicates the individuals strongest preference to one of the 16 personality types.</p></div>
